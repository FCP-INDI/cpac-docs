  - title: C-PAC
    paragraphs:
    - The Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) is an open-source software pipeline for automated preprocessing and analysis of resting-state fMRI data. C-PAC builds upon a robust set of existing software packages including AFNI, FSL, and ANTS, and makes it easy for both novice users and experts to explore their data using a wide array of analytic tools. Users define analysis pipelines by specifying a combination of preprocessing options and analyses to be run on an arbitrary number of subjects. Results can then be compared across groups using the integrated group statistics feature.
  - title: Optimize Large Datasets
    paragraphs:
    - Researchers can now explore functional connectome data from thousands of subjects made public through releases by the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI) and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. With this in mind, C-PAC has been designed to reliably preprocess and analyize data for hundreds of subjects in a single run, either on a single machine or on a compute cluster using Sun Grid Engine, HTCondor, or Portable Batch System.
  - title: Ensure Robust Results
    paragraphs:
    - Different analysis pipelines can produce significantly different results, raising questions about the replicability and reliability of brain imaging findings. C-PAC makes it easy to explore the impact of particular processing decisions by allowing users to run a factorial number of analysis pipelines, each with a different set of preprocessing and analysis options. An integrated Quality Control interface facillitates rapid manual examination of pipeline outputs and selection of subjects to be included in group comparisons.
