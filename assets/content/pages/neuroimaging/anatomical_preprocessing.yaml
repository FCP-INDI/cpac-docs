          - paragraph: Non-Local Means Filtering (NLM)
            details:
              - Non-local means filtering reduces noise by averaging pixel intensities based on similarity, not just proximity, preserving important structural details like edges and fine anatomical features.
              - Unlike traditional smoothing methods (e.g., Gaussian smoothing), which blur the image and reduce sharpness, NLM compares patches of the image to identify similar regions, even if they are spatially distant.
              - This approach is particularly beneficial for structural MRI, where fine details and boundaries between tissues must remain clear.
              - This can possibly improve registration or tissue segmentation results.
          - paragraph: N4 Bias Field Correction
            details:
              - The bias field is a low-frequency artifact in MRI images that results in uneven signal intensity across the image, unrelated to the actual tissue.
              - This method will remove the bias field while preserving the true anatomical contrast in the image.
              - Can be used to improve tissue contrast in MRI images, which can possibly improve registration or tissue segmentation results.
              - If you see a gradient of voxel intensity difference spanning over the length of the image (ex. very light at one end of the head, very dark at the other, with a smooth transition in between that is not related to anatomical boundaries), using this technique may work particularly well with that specific data.
      - paragraph: Brain Masking (Skull-Stripping)
        details:
          - Skull-stripping is the removal of skull and other non-brain tissue like dura and eyes from anatomical images, which could otherwise complicate co-registration and normalization steps.

          - paragraph: Tips
            details: 
            - Consider participant population (e.g., age, neurological condition) and scan quality.
            - High-quality, noise-free data may work well with simpler tools like FSL BET, while noisy or atypical datasets may require more advanced tools like ANTs or FreeSurfer.
            - Always visually inspect! Brain mask quality varies significantly across technique and data.
            - Parameters may need to be optimized to reduce either over-masking or under-masking.
            - With over-masking, loss of critical cortical areas might result.
            - With under-masking, small pieces of skull or dura left on the boundary of the brain can result in over-sized errors in preprocessing downstream in the pipeline.
            - Any sub-optimal result in brain masking resulting in errors in the brainâ€™s boundary can result in lower registration or segmentation quality.
