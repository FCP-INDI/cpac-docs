  - paragraph: The benchmark-FNIRT pipeline is centered around anatomical registration using FSL's FLIRT (linear) and FNIRT (nonlinear) tools. This choice influences downstream processes, ensuring a consistent spatial normalization framework. The pipeline is structured to test a wide range of preprocessing options, providing a comprehensive assessment of the pipeline's performance and stability.​
    subparagraphs:
    - paragraph: Anatomical Preprocessing
      details:
      - Brain Extraction - Utilizes AFNI’s 3dSkullStrip to remove non-brain tissues from anatomical images.
      - Tissue Segmentation - Employs FSL's FAST to segment the brain into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments.
      - Spatial Normalization - Applies FSL's FLIRT for initial linear registration, followed by FNIRT for nonlinear warping to align individual anatomical images to the MNI152 standard space.
    - paragraph: Functional Preprocessing
      details:
      - Motion Correction - Corrects for head motion artifacts in functional MRI data.
      - Slice Timing Correction - Adjusts for timing differences in slice acquisition.
      - Coregistration - Aligns functional images to the anatomical reference using boundary-based registration techniques.
      - Normalization - Warps functional data into MNI space using the transforms derived from anatomical preprocessing.
      - Nuisance Regression - Performs regression to remove confounding signals, including options for global signal regression.
      - Temporal Filtering - Applies bandpass filtering (e.g., 0.01–0.1 Hz) to isolate relevant frequency components.
      - Spatial Smoothing - Applies a Gaussian kernel (e.g., 6mm FWHM) to smooth the data spatially.
