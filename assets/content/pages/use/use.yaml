  - paragraph: Ways to Run
    subparagraphs:
      - paragraph: Container
        details:
          - Docker - Utilize the official Docker image fcpindi/c-pac to run C-PAC on your local machine. This method ensures a consistent environment and simplifies installation.
          - Singularity/Apptainer - Ideal for HPC environments where Docker may not be available. You can convert the Docker image to a Singularity image or use pre-built Singularity images to run C-PAC.
          - cpac Python package - Install the cpac package via pip to manage and run C-PAC containers. This wrapper simplifies execution and allows for additional functionalities like running extra packages (ba_timeseries_gradients, tsconcat).
      - paragraph: High Performance Computing (HPC)
        details:
          - Singularity - Leverage Singularity containers to run C-PAC on HPC systems, ensuring compatibility and ease of deployment.
          - Starcluster - Use Starcluster to set up and manage HPC clusters on AWS or other HPC environments. This setup allows for parallel processing of multiple subjects, enhancing computational efficiency.
      - paragraph: Cloud Platforms
        details:
          - AWS - Deploy C-PAC using the official Amazon Machine Image (AMI) available on the AWS Marketplace. This option supports both single-instance runs and scalable HPC clusters using Starcluster.
          - OpenNeuro - Run C-PAC analyses directly through the OpenNeuro platform, which provides a web interface for processing public neuroimaging datasets without local installation.
          - brainlife.io -  Utilize brainlife.io to run C-PAC pipelines in the cloud, benefiting from its user-friendly interface and integration with various neuroimaging tools.
          - Flywheel -  Integrate C-PAC into the FlyWheel platform to manage and process neuroimaging data within a comprehensive data management system.
